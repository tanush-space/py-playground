# 🐍 py-playground  

Welcome to **py-playground** — my personal coding space where I practice, experiment, and learn Python step by step.  
This repo isn’t just for college assignments, it’s also a place I can come back to later when I need a quick refresh or want to see how far I’ve come.  

I made this for my **future self** too because sometimes you forget the small details you once knew, and a well-kept repo makes it easy to pick things back up.

## 📖 Goals for this repo  

- Keep all my Python practice and projects in one place.  
- Stay organized so I (or anyone else) can follow along easily.  
- Build a habit of writing clean, readable code.  
- Have a reference for my **future self** when I forget the “small things.”  
- Document my growth as I go from basics → advanced → projects.
